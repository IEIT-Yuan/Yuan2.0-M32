##  0. Latest News 🎉🎉

* **[2024-05-28]** **Yuan2.0-M32 released**




##  1. Introduction


**Yuan2.0-M32** is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model with 32 experts, of which 2 are active. A new router network, Attention Router, is proposed and has been adopted for more efficient expert selection, boosting accuracy by 3.8% over models using a classical router network. Yuan 2.0-M32 is trained from scratch with 2000B tokens, and its training computation is only 9.25% of that required by a dense model of the same parameter scale. Demonstrating competitive capabilities in coding, math, and various specialized fields, Yuan2.0-M32 operates with only 3.7B active parameters out of a total 40B, and a forward computation of 7.4 GFLOPS per token, which is just 1/19th of Llama3-70B's requirement. Yuan 2.0-M32 has surpassed Llama3-70B on the MATH and ARC-Challenge benchmarks, achieving accuracies of 55.9% and 95.8%, respectively. The basic information of the **Yuan2.0-M32** model is as follows:

+ **Total Parameters ：** 40B <br>
+ **Experts：** 32 <br>
+ **Active Experts：** 2 <br>
+ **Active Parameters：** 3.7B <br>  
+ **Training Tokens：** 2000B tokens <br>
+ **Sequence Length：** 16K <br>

The technical report for the Yuan2.0-M32 model has been released, and you can find more detailed technical information and evaluation results by referring to the <a href="https://github.com/IEIT-Yuan/Yuan2.0-M32/blob/main/docs/Paper.pdf" target="_blank">**paper**</a>.

##  3. Evaluation


**3.1 Benchmarks** 🏆


We conducted a thorough evaluation of the Yuan2.0-M32 model across a range of benchmarks, including HumanEval, GSM8K, MMLU, Math, and ARC-Challenge. These benchmarks are designed to test the model's proficiency in key areas such as natural language understanding, knowledge acquisition, mathematical computation and reasoning, and code generation. The Yuan2.0-M32 has shown a consistent and significant advantage over other models like Llama3-8B and Mistral-8×7B, excelling in all evaluated tasks. Remarkably, its overall performance is on par with the more substantial Llama3-70B model.The detailed evaluation results are outlined in the subsequent table.
